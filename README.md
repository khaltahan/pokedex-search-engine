Use a search bar to locate Pokédex by name or number

## Lab 2 Objectives:

Create a HTML document that shows a Pokédex for the first 20 Pokémon and shows two search boxes to search for Pokémon by name or number along with input validation as in step A-C of lab 1.

Using JavaScript, modify the DOM of this page so that:

Create a new content block (e.g. DIV) above the first Pokémon.

Create a new list (any list) inside this block and add list elements for all of the search results (not limited as in lab 1). Each list element must have all the information that is present in the full list. E.g. image, description etc.

Dynamically update this list as the user is typing new characters or deleting characters in the search box. E.g. when the user deletes all the characters, the new content block should disappear.

Use JavaScript to create new elements.

Style the new content block to be visually distinct from the full list.

Using valid HTML - check with validator.w3.org and ensure no errors or warnings

Using pure JavaScript without using any external library.
