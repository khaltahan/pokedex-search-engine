Use a search bar to locate Pokédex by name or number

# Lab 1 Objectives:

Create a HTML document that shows a Pokédex for the first 20 Pokémon. 

Images and description (3-4 key fields) for 20 Pokémon available on Owl.

Use an unordered list to display each item and use CSS to visually group each item (e.g. boundary or a fill colour) without the typical bullet in a list.

Credit source material with links at the bottom of the page (see References section).

Display two search boxes at the top of the page. One to search for Pokémon by number and the other to search by name.

Use JavaScript to validate input for the two search boxes. Box 1 should only accept numbers 1-20. Box 2 should only accept A-Z or a-z and no more than 20 characters.

“Enter” key or the “Search” button on each box should display a pop-up message with names and descriptions of all matches (up to 5).

Ensure that all CSS and JavaScript are in separate files.

Use Git to keep track of your work and upload to Github as a private repository.

Create a server on AWS and set up a HTTP server to deploy your HTML page via a public URL.
